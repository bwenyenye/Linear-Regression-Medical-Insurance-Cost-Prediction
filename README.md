# Linear-Regression-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts medical insurance costs using python. It uses a dataset from kaggle.
## About the Project
This is a machine learning project that predicts medical insurance costs using python.
## Prerequisities
In this project we use the following libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from kaggle and is public here.
The columns labelles are as follows:

* age: age of primary beneficiary

* sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

* bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

* children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

* smoker: Smoking

* region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Roadmap
The aim is building a machine learning model that can predict insurance charges based on the features from the data.
I obtaind the isnurance cost data from kaggle.
I did some basic data analysis to better understand the data.
In the data preprocessing stage, i cleaned the data to make it usable for machine learning modelling.
The data was split into a training dataset and a testing dataset in a 80% to 20% proportion respectively.
We fed the data into a Linear Regression model and evaluated it to check how well it perfomed.
I fed new data into the model to predict the cost of insurance
